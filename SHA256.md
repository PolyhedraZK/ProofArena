# SHA256 hash benchmark
## Problem Description
Your prover program is required to read bytes from stdin, and print bytes to stdout. We will have a special judge program (SPJ) to interact with your prover to feed inputs and check outputs. SPJ communicate with prover through prover's stdin and stdout. SPJ will also invoke your verifier to check your proof.

Your prover program needs to print a little endian long long integer `N` to stdout (8 bytes). (We know that some prover works better for specific `N`, so it will be good for provers to choose input size by themselves.)

Then the SPJ will generate `64 * N` bytes and send it to prover's stdin. The prover can read `64 * N` bytes from stdin, for each `64` bytes, you are required to hash them into `32` bytes using the standard `SHA256` hash.

The prover needs to output `32 * N` bytes hash result.

After `32 * N` bytes output, you are required to print your proof bytes to stdout for SPJ to read your proof.

## Sample interaction (denoted as hex, separated by 8 bytes)

- SPJ reads your serialized circuit from your provided `circuit` file.

- SPJ starts your prover program.

- SPJ -> prover's stdin:

SERIALIZED_CIRCUIT_BYTES

- prover's stdout -> SPJ:

`0400000000000000`

- prover's stdout -> SPJ:

`73657475702066696e6973686564` (bytes for string "setup finished", helps SPJ to get your setup time. For prover with no setup, you need to print this immediately, SPJ will set your setup time to `0`)

- SPJ -> prover's stdin:

`0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000`

`0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000001`

`0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000002`

`0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000003`

- prover's stdout -> SPJ:

`f5a5fd42d16a2030 2798ef6ed309979b 43003d2320d9f0e8 ea9831a92759fb4b`

`90f4b39548df55ad 6187a1d20d731ece e78c545b94afd16f 42ef7592d99cd365`

`bdc9bd36ac7f2583 51c81a3155a19ea5 837b6ef164074f01 89d876a5ec17f920`

`ed1e338910836644 d88868b3f7326fad 9262abff7bc13dd4 d1d7eb51cc42f29a`

- prover's stdout -> SPJ:

`7769746e6573732067656e657261746564` (bytes for string "witness generated", helps SPJ to get your program's witness generation time)

- prover's stdout -> SPJ:

YOUR PROOF BYTES
